# Two-Layer-RFID-Security-System
The first layer, followed by a password (e.g., "1234") via keypad as the second layer, built with PIC18F4520 microcontroller, 16x2 LCD, EM-18 RFID module, and 4x4 keypad for access control like door locks. This matches your prior PIC18F4520 implementation where valid RFID prompts password entry, granting access on match or denying otherwise
